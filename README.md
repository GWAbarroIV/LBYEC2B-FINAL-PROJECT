Notes:
Input Data: In a real application, you'd use more specific criteria to gather posture data, such as using angles or qualitative assessments.
Score Calculation: The scoring here is simplified. The actual RULA tool has specific rules for combining scores from different body parts.
Data Storage: The example uses MATLAB's save function to store data. This could be expanded to save data in a more structured format, like a table or database.
Data Visualization: The pie chart is a simple visualization. You might include more detailed charts and graphs depending on the data and analysis needs.
